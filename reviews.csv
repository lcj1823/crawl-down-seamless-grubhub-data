I took pictures of my favorite pies in the whole world!  It was the pumpkin pie that had the mold on the side. There were 2 slices that was delivered along with the chocolate shake that I ordered. I took a picture for all of Hells Kitchen to see what and how much disgusting food is not seen by a typical eater.","Jul 24, 2019"
6,Jonathan,"Typical diner burger, decent","Jul 19, 2019"

12,Kelly,Horrible. Everything was beyond overcooked and they got my order wrong. Will never order from there again. So disappointed ,"Jun 12, 2019"
13,Brian,We received a bad piece of salmon and they would not refund the cost.  We order from this diner all the time but not any more. There are so many other restaurants that are worth your money. Skip this one.,"Jun 03, 2019"
14,Briana,"I had an issue with my first order taking over an hour to come, but the delivery guy was new. The manager refunded me for the cold food and apologized so many times. The next time i ordered the ordered my food came in literally less than 20minutes, I think they remembered my address. I appreciate them being quick and making up for the first bad experience. The chicken tenders were really good + fries. Milkshakes are good too!","May 24, 2019"

18,Keith,"A little pricey but it's my go-to for diner food.  The food is always good, and unlike other places in the neighborhood (I'm lookin' at YOU, Olympic Flame Diner), they take care to prepare your meal as requested and deliver as quickly as possible.  And I have never, ever had to wait longer than 20 minutes for a delivery, even if the estimated wait time was longer than 45 min.  These guys have earned my loyalty!","May 05, 2019"
19,Kandis,The best grilled cheese with bacon I've ever had,"May 03, 2019"
20,Jennifer,"I always order from here because they are usually fast and good. But today a bit disappointed, I ordered my Avocado wrap grilled chicken.  There was NO avocado in it.

28,Azael,"

Do not trust...
They failed to deliver to my home within the time frame asked. 
Do not trust...
They did not send my food to me after I called to ask for my food. They said that they had thrown my food away.

I waited 4 hours to contact them after I realized my 100 dollar order was not here. I wasn't that hungry nor was I waiting for them....so when i noticed that my nearly 100 dollar order was not here, i called and they said that i needed to pay again to get my order delivered... I said why...he said because their person tried to deliver it but nobody answered..... 
.
.
So I guess this person I talked to at Flame Diner is called Sedom? I think that's what he said on the phone.
.
.
I asked what he could do to make this right, he said I need to pay again to get my purchase delivered.
.
.
i don't think they understand that i have a doorman....so if they tried to deliver it to me, my doorman would have let me know...so...in other words....my 100 dollar order was not delivered so i do not trust them.","Mar 15, 2019"

34,Kristen,"Food was good! Ordered the gyro breakfast and eggs. The eggs were supposed to be poached. One was. The other may have broke during transportation? But it wasn’t intact. The gyro meat came alone. Two slices of rye, no butter. The salad was good, but had some brown pieces in it; it wasn’t fresh lettuce. Overall great though. Giving another chance.","Jan 17, 2019"

54,Tylar,"The wrong food was delivered to me. Then when I meet the delivery guy with the right food he made me return upstairs to get the other order he delivered which I find gross because it should not be reused.
